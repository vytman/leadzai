# Leadzai - Weather app

Using the provided boilerplate, build a weather web app that communicates with the
OpenWeatherMap API, with the following functional requirements:

    ● Display the current temperature in a specific city (e.g.:18º C)
    ● The display must include an icon representing the weather (e.g.: a sun)
    ● The sunrise and sunset in local time (e.g.: 07:47 and 18:55)
    ● Switch to toggle the temperature value between Celsius and Fahrenheit
    ● Select with at least 3 cities included, so we can check the weather there

Open Weather Map API URL, with example query for lisbon:
https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?appid=YOUR_API_KEY&q=lisbon
Keep in mind:

    ● A .zip file is provided with a basic boilerplate along with this document. Feel free to
    expand on this boilerplate, but keep dependencies to a minimum.
    ● You must create your own API key and provide it to the app.
    ● Make sure your app is built using separate components.
    ● The CSS has to be done by you. Avoid the use of CSS frameworks (you may use
    SASS or Styled Components).
